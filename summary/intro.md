- What is the book about?
  - This book is a deep dive into the concepts and uses of RxJava in particular, and reactive programming in general.
  - This book serves as both an incremental learning tool and a reference for RxJava.
  - This book is for developers who want to grasp reactive programming and RxJava.
- Outline the parts
  - [Chapter 1](chapter1.md) very briefly goes through the inception of RxJava, basic concepts and ideas.
  - [Chapter 2](chapter2.md) explains how RxJava can appear in your application and how to interact with it.
  - [Chapter 3](chapter3.md) is a tour of the operators provided by RxJava.
  - [Chapter 4](chapter4.md) shows how to embed RxJava across a codebase. It also touches on concurrency.
  - [Chapter 5](chapter5.md) explains how to implement reactive applications from top to bottom.
  - [Chapter 6](chapter6.md) explains an important problem of flow control and backpressure mechanisms in RxJava that support it.
  - [Chapter 7](chapter7.md) shows techniques of unit testing, maintaining and troubleshooting Rx-based applications.
  - [Chapter 8](chapter8.md) shows selected applications of RxJava, especially in distributed systems.
  - [Chapter 9](chapter9.md) highlights future plans for RxJava 2.x.
- What problem(s) are being solved?
